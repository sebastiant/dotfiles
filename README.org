* About
This repository contains my systems setup.
I have three hosts set up by this repository:
- A Lenovo laptop running [[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]]
- The same Lenovo laptop running [[https://www.debian.org/][GNU/Linux debian]]
- A Macbook running macOS
I use [[https://nixos.org/][nix]] as package manager for all hosts.
I use [[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager][Home Manager]] to declare nix packages and configuration to use.
For the macbook I additionally use [[https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin][nix-darwin]] to set up system packages and fonts.
All hosts are configured from their respective [[/hosts][/hosts]] directory, [[hosts/common.nix][hosts/common.nix]] contain shared configuration and program-specific configuration live under [[/programs/][/programs/]]
* My toolbox
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] with plugins such as evil-mode, ivy, projectile, magit, org-mode, lsp-mode and more
- [[https://neovim.io/][neovim]] for basic text editing
- [[https://xmonad.org/][xmonad]] as window-manager, with [[https://dunst-project.org/][Dunst]] for notifications and [[https://polybar.github.io/][polybar]] as status bar
- [[https://www.zsh.org/][Zsh]] with [[https://ohmyz.sh/][Oh My Zsh]] as shell
- [[https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty][Alacritty]] as terminal emulator
- Appearance-wise i use [[https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka][Iosevka]] as my default font and [[https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/][Solarized dark]] as color theme
